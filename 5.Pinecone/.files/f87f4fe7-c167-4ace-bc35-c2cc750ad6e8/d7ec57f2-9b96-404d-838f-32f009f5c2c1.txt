‘Ocean warming, oxygen loss, acidification and a decrease in flux of 
organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean are projected to 
harm habitat-forming cold-water corals, which support high biodiversity, 
partly through decreased calcification, increased dissolution of skeletons, 
and bioerosion (medium confidence)’ (SROCC SPM B5.4; IPCC, 2019c).
Climate regulation and air quality
(Section 3.5.5.2)‘Global ocean heat content continued to increase throughout [the 
1951 to present] period, indicating continuous warming of the entire 
climate system (very high confidence)’ (WGI AR6 TS1.2.3; Arias et al., 
2021).‘The increase in global ocean heat content (TS2.4) will likely continue 
until at least 2300 even for low-emission scenarios’ (WGI AR6 Box TS.9; 
Arias et al., 2021).
‘Land and ocean have taken up a near-constant proportion (globally 
about 56% yr–1) of CO 2 emissions from human activities over the past 
six decades, with regional differences (high confidence)’ (WGI AR6 
SPM A1.1; IPCC, 2021b).‘While natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, 
in absolute terms, a progressively larger amount of CO 2 under higher 
compared to lower CO 2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, 
that is, the proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decrease 
with increasing cumulative CO 2 emissions. This is projected to result in 
a higher proportion of emitted CO 2 remaining in the atmosphere (high 
confidence)’ (WGI AR6 SPM B4.1; IPCC, 2021b).
